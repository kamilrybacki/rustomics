# Rustomics

Molecular Dynamics in Rust

## General overview

This is a molecular dynamics simulation package written in Rust.
It is designed to be fast and easy to use.
A main goal of this project is to learn Rust by implementing a non-trivial project,
based on my experience with molecular dynamics simulations in C++.
